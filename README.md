Trigpoints - a simple trigpoint finder app
------------------------------------------

A simple app I made for a friend to help you find Trigpoints near you. Very much work in progress.

The data currently used for this from Lonewalker's database: https://lonewalker.net/trigtable.php - I've not tested the correctness of this database, and it should be treated as such (see the disclaimer on that page).
